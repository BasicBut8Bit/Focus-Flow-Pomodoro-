      <h2>What is a Pomodoro Timer?</h2>
      <p>
        A Pomodoro timer is a time management tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, a method created by Francesco Cirillo. 
        It involves breaking work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros," 
        separated by short 5-minute breaks. After completing four Pomodoros, you take a longer break, typically 15â€“30 minutes.
